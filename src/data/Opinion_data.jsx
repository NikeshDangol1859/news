    Madhesh Province is set to get a new chief minister. 
    The ruling coalition has decided to elect Satish Singh of the Janamat 
    Party to the position after Saroj Kumar Yadav of the Janata Samajwadi 
    Party lost the vote of confidence following the withdrawal of support by 
    the CPN (Unified Socialist). With this, Madhesh has joined the club of the 
    provinces that have already had one or more government changes in the ongoing 
    term. Now, only Bagmati province has not had any change of government since the 
    provincial governments were formed in November 2022.

        NepJOL now showcases over 400 Nepali journals. 
        Many of these journals are dedicated to natural sciences, 
        medical sciences, engineering and management. There is a sizable number of 
        other journals which publish research in the social sciences and the humanities. 
        Not all of these journals are “alive,” meaning new issues of some of them have not 
        been published for years. However, they have not yet been declared “defunct” by their 
        erstwhile editors. The portal provides general information about each journal. When new 
        issues are uploaded, readers can read their table of contents and find the full texts of 
        the published articles. In the case of many journals, the readers will also be able to access 
        some or all of their back issues.
